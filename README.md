# Typing-test game inspired largely by Monkeytype

**Game is made with HTML, CSS and most importantly ReactJS. New to front-end web dev and this first individual self-project is a way to put my knowledge about front-end web technologies into practice. Performance of code can be further improved in the future.**

**To play just download everything I guess? Not too sure which ones but I think there should be some redundant dependencies in the package.json file. Once done, run**\
`npm install`\
`npm start`
